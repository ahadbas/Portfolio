            <b>SiriusXM Pandora Stations</b>

            <br>
            Towards the end of 2018 SiriusXM had acquired Pandora Media. We began 
            to look for opportunities to cross integrate both of our services. This 
            project spanned four months from research to launch.

            <b>My Role:</b> Product Design Lead
            <br>
            <b>Launched:</b> May 2019
            <br><br>
            <b>Looking for overlap</b>
            <br>– 
            <br>I worked closely with cross functional partners from both Pandora 
            and SiriusXM. 
            <br><br>
            
            <b>Key discovery insights</b>
            <br> –
            <br> Majority of SiriusXM subscribers enjoy the serendipitous nature of radio, they are more 
            interested in discovery than curation.
            <br><br> Approximately 70% of SiriusXM subscribers had used Pandora in the last year.
            <br><br> Users wanted to be able to listen to more music by or similar to what they are hearing on the radio.

            <br><br>
            
            <b>Goal</b>
            <br> –
            <br> Provide users with a more personalized music discovery experience.
            <br> Leverage Pandora’s technology and promote the brand. 
           
            <br><br>
            <b>Solution</b>
            <br>–
            <br> Integrating one of Pandora's core features “Artist Radio” made sense because our users 
            are already accustomed to and enjoy the serendipitous nature of radio. This allowed them 
            to dive into music from or similar to a specific artist right from listening to radio. And 
            for the first time this gave the user more control over what they were listening to, which we 
            felt would be very valuable in driving more user engagement. 
            <br><br>
            <b>Constraints</b>
            <br>–
            <br>• The feature had to be branded with the Pandora logo or naming.
            <br>• Users could only create 250 artist radio stations.
            <br>• When an artist station is created for the first time it is instantly created.
            <br>• This feature had to fit seamlessly within the existing SiriusXM experience.
            <br>• The feature had to be able to scale for future added functionality.
